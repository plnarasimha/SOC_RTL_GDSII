# Simulator (iverilog)

# RTL
Based on specification we write the verilog(RTL) to check that we do simulation
To test the Design we have use the simulator.
Design it's a verilog or a set of verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications

# Validate
with the help of Test bench is the setup to apply stimulus(test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality


# How it works
Based upon look for the changes on the input signal,then changes input the output is evaluated
