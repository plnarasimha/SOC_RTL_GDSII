# Simulator (iverilog)

# RTL
Based on specification we write the verilog(RTL) to check that we do simulation
To test the Design we have use the simulator.
Design it's a verilog or a set of verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet with the required specifications

# Validate
with the help of Test bench is the setup to apply stimulus(test_vectors) to the design to check its functionality

# How it works
Based upon look for the changes on the input signal,then changes input the output is evaluated

# Synthesis
Tool used for converting the RTL to Netlist

# RTL Design

Behavioral represtation of the required specification
# .lib

collection of logical modules ( different flavours )

# Validate
